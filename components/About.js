        <p className="w-75 mt-3">I come from a successful career in the technical/infrastructure side of IT. Iâ€™m fully self taught in that side of the industry; I started as a mobile computer technician and quickly worked my way up into various Systems Administrator roles.
        In 2010 I learned to code in C#, and then undertook 14 months of full-time software development building, improving, and maintaining various .Net Windows applications; both standalone and utilising SQL, including an ASP.net Webforms CRM, and KindCare; a childcare management software.
        Since 2020 I have been freelancing</p>
